# GmailMonitors
A bunch of helper functions and scripts to detect and process bills-related emails.
The scripts are originally written for Israeli local municipalities but may be adapted to whatever scenrario one might need.

I've written these scripts to avoid the exotic limitations of every low-code automation service. 
Since most of this automations is happening inside the Google Workspaces, it's easier and much more permissive to handle it as a google app script
